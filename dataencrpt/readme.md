## Running essentila concepts on data encrption through securing  node js application

 **Requirements are** :
  --node js  latest version ---
  --crpto module --
  ## node js ##
   **It acts as run time environment for js codes on server side**

## Crypo module ##


**The crypto module is built into Node.js and provides cryptographic functionality,
including encryption, decryption, and hashing. Since it's a core module, there's
no need to install it separately. You can require it directly in your Node.js
application**

## For encrption ##

**To encrypt data, you need a secret key. This key can be generated using the
crypto module's randomBytes function. The length of the key depends on the
encryption algorithm you choose (e.g., 32 bytes for AES-256).
